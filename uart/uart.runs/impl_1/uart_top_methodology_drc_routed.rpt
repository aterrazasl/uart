2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on uart_rx relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led0 relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on uart_tx relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch UART_COMP/UART_RX_COMP/next_state_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin UART_COMP/UART_RX_COMP/next_state_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch UART_COMP/UART_RX_COMP/next_state_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin UART_COMP/UART_RX_COMP/next_state_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch UART_COMP/UART_RX_COMP/next_state_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin UART_COMP/UART_RX_COMP/next_state_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch UART_COMP/UART_TX_COMP/next_state_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin UART_COMP/UART_TX_COMP/next_state_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch UART_COMP/UART_TX_COMP/next_state_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin UART_COMP/UART_TX_COMP/next_state_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch UART_COMP/UART_TX_COMP/next_state_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin UART_COMP/UART_TX_COMP/next_state_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
